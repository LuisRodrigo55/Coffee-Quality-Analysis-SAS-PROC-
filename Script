 SAS Project: Coffee Quality Analysis using PROC Functions               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script contains 8 categories of SAS PROCs for data science (most common and used).

IMPORT DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the import of the data into the SAS Environment, the table is allocated in the work space
